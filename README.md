# Latency-Minimizer
Latency Minimizer
An intelligent system optimizer for eliminating input lag and achieving maximum responsiveness in games and applications.

Do you experience annoying “lag” when the action in the game occurs a moment after you click the mouse or press a key? Latency Minimizer is a professional open-source tool that analyzes and fine-tunes your Windows operating system to dramatically reduce the delay between your action and the response on the screen.

We turn your computer into a perfectly tuned system for competitive gaming and real-time work.

How it works: a scientific approach to smoothness
Latency Minimizer is not a magic “booster.” It is a comprehensive optimizer that works on several levels:

Real-Time Process Tuning: The application temporarily raises the priority of critical processes (game, graphics driver, audio driver) to Realtime and lowers the priority of background tasks, minimizing interruptions.

Windows Scheduler Optimization (CPU Scheduling): Adjusts system scheduler settings to reduce DPC (Deferred Procedure Calls) and ISR (Interrupt Service Routines) delays, which are a common cause of microfreezes and lag.

Power and Core Parking Management: Disables the processor's power-saving features (such as core parking) and puts the system into maximum performance mode, ensuring stable CPU clock speeds.

Network Optimization (for online games) - Network Buffer Tuning: Adjusts network adapter buffer sizes and TCP/UDP settings to reduce network jitter and latency within the capabilities of your connection.

Automation of “manual” tweaks (One-Click Optimization): Performs a set of proven and safe registry and system settings optimizations that would take experienced users hours to configure manually.

Key Benefits
Measurable Input Lag Reduction: Feel the difference, especially in first-person shooters (CS2, Valorant), fighting games, and racing simulators. Controls become sharp and predictable.

Stutter Elimination: The system becomes smoother by minimizing background activity and interruptions.

Frame Pacing: Reduces dips and evens out frame rendering times, making the image subjectively smoother even with an unchanged average FPS.

Complete security and reversibility: All changes are made to the RAM or through the system's official APIs. Standard .reg files are created to apply permanent settings. Any change can be instantly reversed with a built-in revert script.

Smart profiles: Create and switch between optimization profiles for different games and workloads, or revert to the stock Windows settings with a single click.

Who is Latency Minimizer designed for?
Esports athletes and competitive gamers, for whom every millisecond of latency can determine the outcome of a round.

Streamers and content creators who need a stable and responsive system for simultaneous gaming, recording, and broadcasting.

Professionals in video editing, 3D rendering, and audio recording, where interface responsiveness is critical.

PC upgrade enthusiasts who want to squeeze the most performance out of their configuration using legal methods.

Critical information: transparency and security
Latency Minimizer is a tool for legally optimizing your operating system within the limits permitted by Microsoft.

It is NOT a cheat, hack, or game modification. The application does not interact with game processes, does not modify game files, and does not provide unfair advantages in multiplayer. It only improves the environment in which the game runs.

It works through documented Windows APIs and utilities: PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), official command line utilities (powercfg, wpr).

Complete code transparency: Every line of code is available for review. You can see exactly which system commands are being executed.

Administrator rights required: Like any low-level system tweaker. Only run from trusted sources.

Warning: Using any optimizers can, in rare cases, lead to system instability if the hardware or drivers are faulty. Always create a system restore point before experimenting.

Why does the community choose Latency Minimizer?
Focus on the main problem: Not an abstract “FPS booster,” but a targeted fight against lag and delays.

Professional level: Implements tweaks used by experienced overclockers and esports teams.

Control and understanding: Each option is explained in detail. You know what you are changing in the system.

Trust through open source code: No hidden miners, Trojans, or spyware. Just clean code for a single purpose.

It works: Thousands of users and tests on modern systems confirm a 10-30% reduction in latency in scenarios limited by system responsiveness.

Take back control of your responsiveness. Make your system faster than ever.
